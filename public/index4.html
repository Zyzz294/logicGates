    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Logic Gates</h1>
    <p>A logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device</p>
    <p>Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays (relay logic), fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements. With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.</p>
    <p>Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. In modern practice, most gates are made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors).</p>
    <p>Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert and OR-AND-Invert are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl hover:font-bold">AND Gate</h2>
    <p>The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction (∧) from mathematical logic – AND gate behaves according to the truth table. A HIGH (1) output results only if all the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH. If not all inputs to the AND gate are HIGH (1), LOW output results. The function can be extended to any number of inputs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-xl hover:font-bold">OR Gate</h2>
    <p>The OR gate is a digital logic gate that implements logical disjunction (∨) from mathematical logic – it behaves according to the truth table. A HIGH (1) output results if one or both the inputs to the gate are HIGH (1). If neither input is high, a LOW output (0) results. In another sense, the function of OR effectively finds the maximum between two binary digits, just as the complementary AND function finds the minimum.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-xl hover:font-bold">XOR Gate</h2>
    <p>XOR gate is a digital logic gate that gives a true (1 or HIGH) output when the number of true inputs is odd. An XOR gate implements an exclusive or from mathematical logic; that is, a true output results if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is true. If both inputs are false (0/LOW) or both are true, a false output results. XOR represents the inequality function, i.e., the output is true if the inputs are not alike otherwise the output is false. A way to remember XOR is "must have one or the other but not both".</p>
